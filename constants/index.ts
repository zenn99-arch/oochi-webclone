Their close attention to detail, and deep thought in terms of narrative, flow, and aesthetics, completely exceeded my expectations, which were very high from the outset. Especially loved and appreciated the creation of visuals, animation, and advice around the look and feel that we are after. We will definitely continue working with Ihor and his team. I cannot recommend them highly enough.",
